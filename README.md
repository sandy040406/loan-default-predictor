# 🧠 Loan Default Predictor Web App

A machine learning-powered Flask web app that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to **repay** or **default**, based on user inputs.

## 🔍 How It Works

- Takes applicant details (income, credit history, loan amount, etc.)
- Predicts default probability using a trained Random Forest model
- Applies custom logic to reduce false predictions
- Returns result with confidence score

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Python**, **Flask**
- **scikit-learn**, **joblib**
- **HTML** + **Bootstrap** (frontend)
- Model trained on cleaned UCI-like loan dataset
